## Exception Handling Exercises

These are some exercises I did that dealt with integers and exception handling. 

In [this project](https://github.com/AustinPat/Integer-Exercise/tree/master/ExceptionHandling/ExceptionHandling) I made lists of numbers then asked the user to enter a number. I then muliplied that number by every number in the array. I also created some exception handling to catch if the number is zero or in the wrong format.
